Verification algorithms can be classified into four (overlapping) groups.

Unsound algorithms can only prove some of the false properties as false, while incomplete algorithms can only prove some of the true properties as true.

Complete algorithms are able to report all correct properties as true, while sound algorithms are able to report all false properties as false.
