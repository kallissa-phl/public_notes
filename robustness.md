__Robustness__ is a property of [[Neural Network]]s that describes how much a network's output is changed by small modifications in the input. 

[[Local robustness]] is concerned with not changing the prediction around specific inputs while [[global robustness]] is concerned with having a separation between regions with different labels in which the classifier must refuse to make a prediction.
